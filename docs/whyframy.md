# Why Framy?

The idea behind Framy is to allow developers, designers, testers, managers and clients to easily access the components used in the Flutter app.

Framy is annotation-driven tool based on which you can generate:
* a style guide describing the theme of your app
* a component gallery showing the widgets you have written in out-of-context way
* a playground for testing widgets with a variety of dependencies
* and much more coming soon...


## What makes Framy special?
* Fully responsive
  * The generated application is mobile, tablet, desktop and web friendly. Framy generates a separate main file with a separate MaterialApp but it does use the same widgets you are using in your own Flutter app.
* Standalone
  * You can easily host generated app the way you prefer or just run it locally. (Automated hosting of Framy App is planned as well ðŸ˜‰)
* Non-invasive
  * Framy doesn't require using any special widgets to be working. There is no `Framy` widget to wrap your app in so it doesn't affect your actual product. Only annotations.
